GitHub is a hosting platform used by developers to save their code online and track its changes to see what will work when it comes to them working on their projects. GitHub is popular among people in the IT industry due to its easy-to-understand UI and its ability to act as a progress tracker using a Version Control System to track changes. This enables projects to be collaborative.
